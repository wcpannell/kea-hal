# KEA-HAL

A Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) implementing
[embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits
for the NXP KEA family of MCUs. Only the KEA64 (SKEAZN642) sub family is currently supported. This HAL depends upon the
[SKEAZN642 Peripherial Access Crate](https://github.com/wcpannell/SKEAZN642).

## Status

This project is under development. If it doesn't work, then it's probably not
implemented. Pull requests welcome. This is a side project, expect delays in
response.
