//! # SIM - System Integration Module
//!
//! ## SIM_SCGC - System Clock Gating Control Register
//!
//! This module controls whether or not a module is connected to the bus clock.
//! This register is controlled by each peripherals respective (software)
//! module.
//!
//! ## SIM_BUSDIV
//!
//! This contains a single bit field that controls whether the bus divider is
//! equal to or half that of the system clock. Because the maximum allowed
//! speed of the bus clock is 20MHz compared to the 40MHz allowed for the
//! system clock, the bus clock divider must be set appropriately if the system
//! clock exceeds 20MHz. By default the system clock is 16MHz.
//!
//!
//! ## SIM_SOPT - System Options Register
//!
//! The SIM holds system configuration options, such as trigger sources, RESET
//! pin usage, etc. All of the options will be implemented in their respective
//! (software) modules. For example reset pin usage is handled by [crate::gpio]
//! , and the bus divider is handled by [crate::clocks].
//!
//! ## UUID
//!
//! the MCU's 64bit UUID.
//!
//! ## SIM_PINSEL - Pin Selection Register
//!
//! The SIM also holds the Pin Selection Register (SIM_PINSEL) which configures
//! the pins that certain peripherals use for inputs and outputs. This
//! functionality is not controlled by this (software) module, but is instead
//! implemented by their repsective modules. For example SIM_PINSEL\[UART0\] is
//! handled within the UART (software) module.
